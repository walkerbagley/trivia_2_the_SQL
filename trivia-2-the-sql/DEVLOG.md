# Assigned

### Dagny
- [ ] Creating a deck should add it to the UserDecks table
    - see the DecksPage for how to get userid, but this needs to be a js file for it to work, otherwise you need to create a ts version of UserProvider.js

### Patrick
- [x] diable answer buttons if the answer option is null
- [x] Enable filtering to just view your decks on the decks page
- [ ] Add team scores to game page

### Walker
- [ ] Can't read deck name on the host page due to the font color
- [ ] Head size adjusted (thinner)
- [ ] Ensure formatting reaches the bottom of the page on a monitor sized screen
- [ ] Ensure all pages go up to the bottom of the header

### Zach
